"""A placement is a final arrangement of jobs at given (X,Y) positions.
This class is intended to "un-pack" an arragement of jobs constructed
manually through Layout/Panel/JobLayout/etc. (i.e., a layout.def file)
or automatically through a Tiling. From either source, the result is
simply a list of jobs.
